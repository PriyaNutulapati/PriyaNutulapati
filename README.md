**Master's Student in Information Management | Data Engineer/Analyst | Machine Learning Enthusiast**

I am a Master's graduate in Information Technology, where I focused on subjects like Big Data, Business Intelligence, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Web-Based Solutions. My academic foundation, combined with over three years of experience in software development and nearly two years in data engineering, has equipped me to design and implement innovative solutions. At Infosys, I developed efficient data pipelines in Databricks using AWS services like S3 and Lambda, optimizing ETL workflows and streamlining operations with Python and SQL. Prior to that, at Cognizant, I created scalable solutions using Java, Spring Boot, and microservices architecture, leading projects that improved customer engagement and system performance. I am passionate about leveraging my expertise to work on impactful projects in data engineering and analytics, channeling my dedication to creating data-driven solutions that drive business success.
